It's not perfect but it's work!. This is the best that I've made in one week and I am proud of it. i added cool libraries, the detail, and kakoi UI design to get this website more interactive and fun to see. I know it's not satisfactory enough from a large company perspective but I learn a lot from this project. I willing to learn more about standard of how web development work flow in big companies like Tokopedia. I hope this project assignment will be my ticket to be a part of Tokopedia nakama journey in the future!. Thank you so much.
